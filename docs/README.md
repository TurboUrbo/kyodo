# Kyodo
**Kyodo**
the crossplatform incentive tool for building crypto economy for DAO based on Impression revenue model. We build Kyodo to run Decent.Fund. 
As an organisational structure it's defined as Adhocracy
As a governance it has two models Democracy and Meritocracy.

Colony: Decent.Fund
**Decent.Fund mission** is to contribute to the mass adoption of the decentrilezed solutions, making the concepts of the new crypto economy closer to unchain world. According to the mission Decent.Fund focuses on following activities:

1. UI/UX design
2. Programming
3. Digital marketing
4. Research
5. Education
6. Fund management 

Decent.Find aims to grow the community of people who are interested in experiments in building the decentralized organization which embraces individual and social interests, economic efficiency and incentive mechanism for growing.

## Task management models
There are two oppsite models of the Task management in Kyodo:

1. Impression revenue model
The contribution is done without an inintial task setting. 
A contributor posts the contribution to Riot/Colony → Domain's members evaluate the contribution by tipping → send tips with Riot bot → the contributor gets his DF tokens

2. Task managment model
Everybody can iniciate task by staking DF token.
The process:
stake task → add task description → assign roles →  define amount of DF token to stake to participate → define reward tasks  → open task

## Installation
To run the whole Kyodo project you need to setup 3 projects:
- Kyodo (this repository) to setup colony, sign final tips, get your balance and view tasks progress
- Kyodo backend to run mongodb server and tipping watch within period
- Kyodo bot to run riot bot for task creation and instant tipping


### To setup web app

```
git clone https://github.com/decentfund/kyodo.git
cd kyodo
yarn
```

### Start ganache

```
ganache-cli --gasLimit 7000000 -b 3
```

### Create initial distribution of tokens

```
cp migrations/deploy_parameters.example.json migrations/deploy_parameters.json
```

Change `deploy_parameters.json` to reflect the initial distribution you want or leave accounts section empty.

### Compile smart-contracts:
We implement ERC-20 token contract to bootstrap app based on OpenZeppelin ERC20 Mintable token and Ownable contracts, for working with strings we utilize strings.sol library.

```
truffle migrate --reset --compile-all
```

### Start frontend app

```
yarn start
```

Don't forget to switch Metamask network to localhost:8545


### Testing

```
// Truffle teste
npm run truffle:test

// App tests
npm run jest
```
